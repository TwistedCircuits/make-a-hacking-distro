# make-a-hacking-distro
This is a script to install basic tools to start hacking. Should be able to run on most, if not all, Linux distros. 
This repository is a collection of bash scripts that can be used to turn an ordinary Linux distro intro into a hacking distro.
These scripts must be installed in a specific order. You must download and run the programming.sh file in order to install anything else.
The security.sh file contains various programs to make your linux dsitro more secure.
OSINT tools installed Sherlock, Twint(has some problems), OSINTgram, Spiderfoot, theHarvester, and Maltego.
Recon tools installed NMAP, SQLMap, OpenVAS.
Exploitation tools installed Burpsuite, Metasploit Framework.

(Sorry this script is a work in progress. Please forgive me for not having it done yet.)
